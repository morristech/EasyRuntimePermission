**Simple listener-based API to handle runtime permissions.**

## Configuration
#### Add to your gradle 
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/shaz-tech/EasyRuntimePermission.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#shaz-tech/EasyRuntimePermission)
```groovy
    allprojects {
            repositories {
                ...
                maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
            }
     }
        
     dependencies {
        	 implementation 'com.github.shaz-tech:EasyRuntimePermission:1.1'
     }
```

## Setup
### Add to your Activity that's all
```java
    @Override
        public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, @NonNull String[] permissions, @NonNull int[] grantResults) {
            super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
            RuntimePermissionHandler.onRequestPermissionsResult(this, requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
        }
```

## Usage
### Call
```java
    /*Call when required to do some task related to permission*/
    RuntimePermissionHandler.requestPermission(YOUR_REQUEST_CODE, CURRENT_ACTIVITY, PERMISSION_LISTENER_INSTANCE, BUNCH_OF_PERMISSIONS);
```
### Handling
```java
    /*Handle your job only from onAllowed() of PERMISSION_LISTENER_INSTANCE*/
    @Override
    public void onAllowed(int requestCode, @NonNull String[] permissions) {
          switch (requestCode) {
              case YOUR_REQUEST_CODE:
                   //TODO Do your stuffs from here
                   break;
                }
            }
```

## With Xiaomi support
Since Xiaomi manipulates something around runtime permission mechanism Google's recommended way doesn't work well. But don't worry, EasyRuntimePermission supports it!
